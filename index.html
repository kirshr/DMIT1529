              Dracula is a novel by Bram Stoker, published in 1897. As an
              epistolary novel, the narrative is related through letters, diary
              entries, and newspaper articles. It has no single protagonist, but
              opens with solicitor Jonathan Harker taking a business trip to
              stay at the castle of a Transylvanian noble, Count Dracula. Harker
              escapes the castle after discovering that Dracula is a vampire,
              and the Count moves to England and plagues the seaside town of
              Whitby. A small group, led by Abraham Van Helsing, hunt Dracula
              and, in the end, kill him.

              Dracula was mostly written in the 1890s. Stoker produced over a
              hundred pages of notes for the novel, drawing extensively from
              Transylvanian folklore and history. Some scholars have suggested
              that the character of Dracula was inspired by historical figures
              like the Wallachian prince Vlad the Impaler or the countess
              Elizabeth Báthory, but there is widespread disagreement. Stoker's
              notes mention neither figure. He found the name Dracula in
              Whitby's public library while holidaying there, picking it because
              he thought it meant devil in Romanian.

              Following its publication, Dracula was positively received by
              reviewers who pointed to its effective use of horror. In contrast,
              reviewers who wrote negatively of the novel regarded it as
              excessively frightening. Comparisons to other works of Gothic
              fiction were common, including its structural similarity to Wilkie
              Collins' The Woman in White (1859). In the past century, Dracula
              has been situated as a piece of Gothic fiction. Modern scholars
              explore the novel within its historical context—the Victorian
              era—and discuss its depiction of gender roles, sexuality, and
              race.

          Dracula is one of the most famous pieces of English literature. Many
          of the book's characters have entered popular culture as archetypal
          versions of their characters; for example, Count Dracula as the
          quintessential vampire, and Abraham Van Helsing as an iconic vampire
          hunter. The novel, which is in the public domain, has been adapted for
          film over 30 times, and its characters have made numerous appearances
          in virtually all media.

          <h2>Plot</h2>
          <p>
            Jonathan Harker, a newly qualified English solicitor, visits Count
            Dracula at his castle in the Carpathian Mountains to help the Count
            purchase a house near London. Ignoring the Count's warning, Harker
            wanders the castle and encounters three vampire women; Dracula
            rescues Harker, and gives the women a small child bound inside a
            bag. Harker awakens in bed; soon after, Dracula leaves the castle,
            abandoning him to the women; Harker escapes with his life and ends
            up delirious in a Budapest hospital.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dracula takes a ship for England with boxes of earth from his
            castle. The captain's log narrates the crew's disappearance until he
            alone remains, bound to the helm to maintain course. An animal
            resembling a large dog is seen leaping ashore when the ship runs
            aground at Whitby.
          </p>

          <p>
            Lucy Westenra's letter to her best friend, Harker's fiancée Mina
            Murray, describes her marriage proposals from Dr. John Seward,
            Quincey Morris, and Arthur Holmwood. Lucy accepts Holmwood's, but
            all remain friends. Mina joins her friend Lucy on holiday in Whitby.
            Lucy begins sleepwalking. After his ship lands there, Dracula stalks
            Lucy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mina receives a letter about her missing fiancé's illness, and goes
            to Budapest to nurse him. Lucy becomes very ill. Seward's old
            teacher, Professor Abraham Van Helsing, determines the nature of
            Lucy's condition, but refuses to disclose it. He diagnoses her with
            acute blood-loss.
          </p>
          <p>
            Van Helsing places garlic flowers around her room and makes her a
            necklace of them. Lucy's mother removes the garlic flowers, not
            knowing they repel vampires. While Seward and Van Helsing are
            absent, Lucy and her mother are terrified by a wolf and Mrs.
            Westenra dies of a heart attack; Lucy dies shortly thereafter. After
            her burial, newspapers report children being stalked in the night by
            a "bloofer lady" (beautiful lady), and Van Helsing deduces it is
            Lucy. The four go to her tomb and see that she is a vampire. They
            stake her heart, behead her, and fill her mouth with garlic.
            Jonathan Harker and his now-wife Mina have returned, and they join
            the campaign against Dracula.
          </p>

          <p>
            Everyone stays at Dr. Seward's asylum as the men begin to hunt
            Dracula. Van Helsing finally reveals that vampires can only rest on
            earth from their homeland. Dracula communicates with Seward's
            patient, Renfield, an insane man who eats vermin to absorb their
            life force.
          </p>
          <p>
            After Dracula learns of the group's plot against him, he uses
            Renfield to enter the asylum. He secretly attacks Mina three times,
            drinking her blood each time and forcing Mina to drink his blood on
            the final visit. She is cursed to become a vampire after her death
            unless Dracula is killed. As the men find Dracula's properties, they
            discover many earth boxes within. The vampire hunters open each of
            the boxes and seal wafers of sacramental bread inside them,
            rendering them useless to Dracula. They attempt to trap the Count in
            his Piccadilly house, but he escapes. They learn that Dracula is
            fleeing to his castle in Transylvania with his last box. Mina has a
            faint psychic connection to Dracula, which Van Helsing exploits via
            hypnosis to track Dracula's movements. Guided by Mina, they pursue
            him.
          </p>

          <p>
            In Galatz, Romania, the hunters split up. Van Helsing and Mina go to
            Dracula's castle, where the professor destroys the vampire women.
            Jonathan Harker and Arthur Holmwood follow Dracula's boat on the
            river, while Quincey Morris and John Seward parallel them on land.
            After Dracula's box is finally loaded onto a wagon by Szgany men,
            the hunters converge and attack it. After routing the Szgany, Harker
            slashes Dracula's neck and Quincey stabs him in the heart. Dracula
            crumbles to dust, freeing Mina from her vampiric curse. Quincey is
            mortally wounded in the fight against the Szgany. He dies from his
            wounds, at peace with the knowledge that Mina is saved. A note by
            Jonathan Harker seven years later states that the Harkers have a
            son, named Quincey.

            As the acting manager of the Lyceum Theatre in London, Bram Stoker
            was a recognisable figure: he would greet evening guests, and served
            as assistant to the stage actor Henry Irving. In a letter to Walt
            Whitman, Stoker described his own temperament as "secretive to the
            world", but he nonetheless led a relatively public life. Stoker
            supplemented his income from the theatre by writing romance and
            sensation novels, and had published 18 books by his death in 1912.
            Dracula was Stoker's seventh published book, following The Shoulder
            of Shasta (1895) and preceding Miss Betty (1898). Hall Caine, a
            close friend of Stoker's, wrote an obituary for him in The Daily
            Telegraph, saying that—besides his biography on Irving—Stoker wrote
            only "to sell" and "had no higher aims".

              Vlad III, more commonly known as Vlad the Impaler Many figures
              have been suggested as inspirations for Count Dracula, but there
              is no consensus. In his 1962 biography of Stoker, Harry Ludlam
              suggested that Ármin Vámbéry, a professor at the University of
              Budapest, supplied Stoker with information about Vlad Drăculea,
              commonly known as Vlad the Impaler.[10] Professors Raymond T.
              McNally and Radu Florescu popularised the idea in their 1972 book,
              In Search of Dracula.
            </p>
            <p>
              Benjamin H. LeBlanc writes that there is a reference within the
              text to Vámbéry, an "Arminius, of Buda-Pesh University", who is
              familiar with the historical Vlad III and is a friend of Abraham
              Van Helsing, but an investigation by McNally and Florescu found
              nothing about "Vlad, Dracula, or vampires" within Vámbéry's
              published papers, nor in Stoker's notes about his meeting with
              Vámbéry. Academic and Dracula scholar Elizabeth Miller calls the
              link to Vlad III "tenuous", indicating that Stoker incorporated a
              large amount of "insignificant detail" from his research, and
              rhetorically asking why he would omit Vlad III's infamous cruelty.
            </p>
            <p>
              Raymond McNally's Dracula Was A Woman (1983) suggests another
              historical figure as an inspiration: Elizabeth Báthory.McNally
              argues that the imagery of Dracula has analogues in Báthory's
              described crimes, such as the use of a cage resembling an iron
              maiden. Gothic critic and lecturer Marie Mulvey-Roberts writes
              that vampires were traditionally depicted as "mouldering
              revenants, who dragged themselves around graveyards", but—like
              Báthory—Dracula uses blood to restore his youth. Recent
              scholarship has questioned whether Báthory's crimes were
              exaggerated by her political opponents, with others noting that
              very little is concretely known about her life.
            </p>
            <p>
              A book that Stoker used for research, The Book of Were-Wolves,
              does have some information on Báthory, but Miller writes that he
              never took notes on anything from the short section devoted to
              her. In a facsimile edition of Bram Stoker's original notes for
              the book, Miller and her co-author Robert Eighteen-Bisang say in a
              footnote that there is no evidence she inspired Stoker. In 2000,
              Miller's book-length study, Dracula: Sense and Nonsense, was said
              by academic Noel Chevalier to correct "not only leading Dracula
              scholars, but non-specialists and popular film and television
              documentaries".
            </p>
            <p>
              Aside from the historical, Count Dracula also has literary
              progenitors. Academic Elizabeth Signorotti argues that Dracula is
              a response to the lesbian vampire of Sheridan Le Fanu's Carmilla
              (1872), "correcting" its emphasis on female desire.[26] Bram
              Stoker's great-nephew, broadcaster Daniel Farson, wrote a
              biography of the author; in it, he doubts that Stoker was aware of
              the lesbian elements of Carmilla, but nonetheless notes that it
              influenced him profoundly. Farson writes that an inscription upon
              a tomb in Dracula is a direct allusion to Carmilla.
            </p>
            <p>
              Scholar Alison Milbank observes that as Dracula can transform into
              a dog, Carmilla can become a cat. According to author Patrick
              McGrath, "traces of Carmilla" can be found in the three female
              vampires residing in Dracula's castle. A short story written by
              Stoker and published after his death, "Dracula's Guest", has been
              seen as evidence of Carmilla's influence. According to Milbank,
              the story was a deleted first chapter from early in the original
              manuscript, and replicates Carmilla's setting of Styria instead of
              Transylvania.

          <h2>Major Themes</h2>
          <h3>Gender and sexuality</h3>
          <p>
            Academic analyses of Dracula as sexually charged have become so
            frequent that a cottage industry has developed around the topic.
            Sexuality and seduction are two of the novel's most frequently
            discussed themes, especially as it relates to the corruption of
            English womanhood. Modern critical writings about vampirism widely
            acknowledge its link to sex and sexuality. Bram Stoker himself was
            possibly homosexual; Talia Schaffer points to intensely homoerotic
            letters sent by him to the American poet Walt Whitman. Stoker began
            writing the novel one month following the imprisonment of his friend
            Oscar Wilde for homosexuality.
          </p>
          <p>
            The novel's characters are often said to represent transgressive
            sexuality through the performance of their genders. The primary
            sexual threat posed by Count Dracula is, Christopher Craft writes,
            that he will "seduce, penetrate, [and] drain another male", with
            Jonathan Harker's excitement about being penetrated by three vampire
            women serving as a mask and proxy for his homosexual desire. His
            excitement also inverts standard Victorian gender roles; in
            succumbing to the vampire women, Harker assumes the traditionally
            feminine role of sexual passivity while the vampire women assume the
            masculinised role of acting.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sexual depravity and aggression were understood by the Victorians as
            the exclusive domain of Victorian men, while women were expected to
            submit to their husband's sexual wishes. Harker's desire to submit,
            and the scene's origin as a dream Stoker had, highlights the divide
            between societal expectations and lived realities of men who wanted
            more freedom in their sexual lives. In the British version of the
            text, Harker hears the three vampire women whispering at his door,
            and Dracula tells them they can feed on him tomorrow night. In the
            American version, Dracula insinuates that he will be feeding on
            Harker that night: "To-night is mine! To-morrow is yours!" Nina
            Auerbach and David J. Skal, in the Norton Critical Edition of the
            text, posit that Stoker thought the line would render the novel
            unpublishable in 1897 England, and that "the America that produced
            his hero Walt Whitman would have been more tolerant of men feeding
            on men".
          </p>
          <p>
            The novel's depiction of women continues to divide critics. Elaine
            Showalter writes that Lucy Westenra and Mina Harker represent
            different aspects of the New Woman. According to Showalter, Lucy
            represents the "sexual daring" of the New Woman, evidenced by how
            she wonders why a woman cannot marry three men if they all desire
            her. Mina, meanwhile, represents the New Woman's "intellectual
            ambitions", citing her occupation as a schoolmaster, her keen mind,
            and her knowledge of shorthand.
          </p>
          <p>
            Carol A. Senf writes that Stoker was ambivalent about the New Woman
            phenomenon. Of the novel's five vampires, four are women, and all
            are aggressive, "wildly erotic", and driven only by their thirst for
            blood. Mina Harker, meanwhile, serves as the antithesis of the other
            female characters, and plays a singularly important role in
            Dracula's defeat. On the other hand, Judith Wasserman argues that
            the fight to defeat Dracula is really a battle for control over
            women's bodies. Senf points out that Lucy's sexual awakening, and
            her reversal of gender-based sexual roles, is what Abraham Van
            Helsing considers a threat.
          </p>
          <h3>Disease</h3>
          <p>
            The novel's representation of vampirism has been discussed as
            symbolising Victorian anxieties about disease. The theme is
            discussed with far less frequency than others because it is
            discussed alongside other topics rather than as the central object
            of discussion. For example, some connect its depiction of disease
            with race.
          </p>
          <p>
            Jack Halberstam points to one scene in which an English worker says
            that the repugnant odour of Count Dracula's London home smells like
            Jerusalem, making it a "Jewish smell". Jewish people were frequently
            described, in Victorian literature, as parasites; Halberstam
            highlights one particular fear that Jews would spread diseases of
            the blood, and one journalist's description of Jews as "Yiddish
            bloodsuckers". In contrast, Mathias Clasen writes parallels between
            vampirism and sexually-transmitted diseases, specifically syphilis.

            Martin Willis, a researcher focused on the intersection of
            literature and disease, argues that the novel's characterisation of
            vampirism makes it both the initial infection and resulting illness.

            Dracula was not the first piece of literature to depict vampires,
            but the novel has nonetheless come to dominate both popular and
            scholarly treatments of vampire fiction. Count Dracula is the first
            character to come to mind when people discuss vampires. Dracula's
            succeeded by drawing together folklore, legend, vampire fiction and
            the conventions of the Gothic novel.

            Wendy Doniger described the novel as vampire literature's
            "centrepiece, rendering all other vampires BS or AS". It profoundly
            shaped the popular understanding of how vampires function, including
            their strengths, weaknesses, and other characteristics. Bats had
            been associated with vampires before Dracula as a result of the
            vampire bat's existence—for example, Varney the Vampire (1847)
            included an image of a bat on its cover illustration. But Stoker
            deepened the association by making Dracula able to transform into
            one. That was, in turn, quickly taken up by film studios looking for
            opportunities to use special effects.

            Patrick McGrath notes that many of the Count's characteristics have
            been adopted by artists succeeding Stoker in depicting vampires,
            turning those fixtures into clichés. Aside from the Count's ability
            to transform, McGrath specifically highlights his hatred of garlic,
            sunlight, and crucifixes. William Hughes writes critically of the
            Count's cultural omnipresence, noting that the character of Dracula
            has "seriously inhibited" discussions of the undead in Gothic
            fiction.

            Adaptations of the novel and its characters have contributed to its
            enduring popularity. Even within academic discussions, the
            boundaries between Stoker's novel and the character's adaptation
            across a range of media have effectively been blurred. Dacre Stoker
            suggests that Stoker's failure to comply with United States
            copyright law contributed to its enduring status, writing that
            writers and producers did not need to pay a licence fee to use the
            character.
